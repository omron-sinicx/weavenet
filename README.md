### üß∞ API
- [An API document for this repository](https://omron-sinicx.github.io/weavenet/main/)
### ü¶æ motivation of the WeaveNet architecture
- A trainable neural solver for general assignment tasks, including bipartite matching, linear assignment with stochastic noise, and stable matching (a.k.a. stable marriage problem).
- It can be combined with feature extractor for registration tasks. See [this example](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02149) for more details.

### Requirements
- This package requires python3.7+, pytorch, and torch-scatter.

### install from GitHub.com
- `pip install git+https://github.com/omron-sinicx/weavenet`

### a minimum sample code

#### Case1: Apply WeaveNet to matching based on extracted features

```python:case1.py
from weavenet.model import TrainableMatchingModule, WeaveNetHead

matching_module = TrainableMatchingModule(
    head = WeaveNetHead(
        input_channels=512, # channels of input vertex features
        output_channels_list=[32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32] # output channels of each layers
        mid_channels_list=[64, 64, 64, 64, 64, 64] # intermediate channels of each layers
        calc_residual=[False] * 6 # do not connect residual path
        keep_first_var_after = 0 # keep the first layer output as the source of first residual path.      
   )
  output_channels = 1 # output only 1 matching matrix.
  pre_interactor = CrossConcatVertexFeatures(),
)


z_src = some_feature_extractor.forward(x_src) # z_src.shape = [B, N, C]
z_tar = some_feature_extractor.forward(x_tar)# z_src.shape = [B, M, C]
matching = matching_module.forward(x_src, x_tar) # matching.shape = [B, 1, N, M]

```

#### Case2: Apply WeaveNet to solve stable matching.
```python:case2.py
from weavenet.model import TrainableMatchingModule, WeaveNetHead

matching_module = TrainableMatchingModule(
    head = WeaveNetHead(
        input_channels=2, # channels of input problem instance.
        output_channels_list=[32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32] # output channels of each layers
        mid_channels_list=[64, 64, 64, 64, 64, 64] # intermediate channels of each layers
        calc_residual=[False] * 6 # do not connect residual path
        keep_first_var_after = 0 # keep the first layer output as the source of first residual path.      
   )
  output_channels = 1 # output only 1 matching matrix.
)

# sab stands for satisfaction_a2b, and sba_t stands for satisfaction_b2a_transposed
sab, sba_t = batch # sab.shape = [B, N, M, 1], sba_t.shape = [B, N, M, 1]. 

matching = matching_module.forward(sab, sba_t) # matching.shape = [B, 1, N, M]

```

### Features from original implementation
- Optimized for jit execution.
- Better interface for light use.
- New class interface design for easy customization of the matching network.
